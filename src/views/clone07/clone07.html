          <h3>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
            since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have
            developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed
            and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
            experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
            Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed
            by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De
            Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own
            large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central
            London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either
            through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an
            example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by
            Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control
            over the use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
            elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
            iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
            established a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents
            for both new-build and existing properties.

          <h3>Who are we?</h3>
          <p>
            We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
            interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than brick
            and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our environment.
            Our practice specializes in design-led and highly crafted
            renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an ability to
            deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst safeguarding our
            clients’ commercial interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central
            London. Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the
            practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK;
            predominantly in the east and southeast of England but also
            including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience
            working in rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent
            and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of farmstead and
            country house projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients.
            These projects often involve sensitive restoration of listed
            buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build additions.
            The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious design
            solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing that buildings
            are often now required to perform different functions and should
            consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower carbon design
            solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate renewable
            technologies wherever possible.

          <h3>Our Services</h3>
          <p>
            We offer complete design and management services with an objective
            to always strive to add value through design. Our work is often for
            forward-thinking owner-occupiers and developer clients, where we
            seek to build relationships founded on a personal service,
            creativity and shared ambition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our services include Architecture, Interior Design and Project
            Management. We have a record of obtaining hard-won Planning and
            Listed Building Permissions, working in strict legislative urban
            environments such as The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,
            London Borough of Camden, and City of Westminster. Outside of London
            we have experience working in National Parks, Areas of Outstanding
            Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Green Belt and
            other designated areas.

          <h3>Our Conservation Services</h3>
          <p>
            Much of our work, specifically that in Prime Central London,
            involves the refurbishment, alteration and extension of houses and
            historic buildings that are often Listed. This is often referred to
            as Conservation Architecture. Rodić Davidson have experience at
            working with all grades of Listed Building: whether these be Grade
            2, Grade 2* or Grade 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design response sometimes looks to introduce modern insertions
            into historic buildings, thereby providing visual separation between
            elements and allowing the historic fabric to be repaired using
            traditional methods and materials. This approach can result in
            clearly articulated functional spaces, allowing appreciation of the
            traditionally proportioned rooms and spaces but also combining new,
            larger spaces with clean crisp lines.
